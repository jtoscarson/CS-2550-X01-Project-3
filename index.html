                <p class="aboutText">This website is dedicated to the information about how online classes are literally the worst method of learning. I am not talking about self learning, as I believe that is the best, because it comes from a place of self-motivation. Basically I have hated this entire experience. So with the prompt of "Chose a theme of interest of yours." This was the easiest and by far the most real. I could have picked some random crap but I chose to pick a topic that is actually relevant. I feel like the default for online classes is "Here is an online book, that takes forever to read it, not to mention is the driest book you will ever see, let alone answer all of the questions that are required for the daily, bi-weekly, or weekly assignments. Oh and on top of that crappy busy work that I (the teacher) literally put no effort into the assignments and just take whatever grade it tells me." I could have waited for the SRIs, and I am sure that I will reiterate my comtempt for this format of class. But what is the point in complaining that the class is worth as much as an online book at the end of the semester. Why don't I just buy the book and go through it without paying for the 1000$ class? Because that book does not offer a piece of paper at the end of it. Which is literally the only thing that college can offer me, a piece of paper. I hope that changes are made to either make online classes suck less or to at least try to offer more in person classes. I am not trying to attack anyone but it is easier to form thoughts in written form, at least for me.
